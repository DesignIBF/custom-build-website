# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves restructuring the iBuyFlowers website into a fully modular system where each component has its own dedicated HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON files. The system should eliminate duplicate IDs, provide clear separation of concerns, and create a scalable architecture for easy maintenance and development.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Modular File Structure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want each module to have its own dedicated files, so that I can easily maintain and update individual components without affecting others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a module is created THEN the system SHALL have separate HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON files for that module
2. WHEN modules are organized THEN the system SHALL have a clear folder structure separating completed modules from work-in-progress
3. WHEN CSS is extracted THEN the system SHALL move module-specific styles from styles.css to dedicated module CSS files
4. IF a module requires JavaScript THEN the system SHALL have a dedicated JS file for that module's functionality
5. WHEN modules are loaded THEN the system SHALL use a consistent naming convention across all file types

### Requirement 2: Eliminate Duplicate IDs

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to avoid HTML validation errors and conflicts, so that the website maintains proper HTML structure and functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are rendered THEN the system SHALL use class selectors instead of duplicate IDs
2. WHEN multiple instances of a component exist THEN the system SHALL not create conflicting ID attributes
3. WHEN the content loader populates components THEN the system SHALL target elements using class selectors
4. IF container divs are needed for loading THEN the system SHALL maintain unique IDs only for loading containers
5. WHEN components are styled THEN the system SHALL use CSS class selectors for styling

### Requirement 3: Completed Modules Organization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to clearly distinguish between completed and in-progress modules, so that I can easily identify which components are ready for production use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN modules are completed THEN the system SHALL move them to a dedicated "completed" folder structure
2. WHEN a module is marked as completed THEN the system SHALL ensure it has all required files (HTML, CSS, JS, JSON)
3. WHEN completed modules are organized THEN the system SHALL maintain the same file structure as work-in-progress modules
4. IF a completed module needs updates THEN the system SHALL allow easy modification without breaking the structure
5. WHEN the project is reviewed THEN the system SHALL clearly show which modules are production-ready

### Requirement 4: Content Loading System Enhancement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the content loading system to work seamlessly with the modular structure, so that all components load their data correctly from their dedicated JSON files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the content loader runs THEN the system SHALL automatically find and load JSON data for each module
2. WHEN modules are moved to completed status THEN the system SHALL continue to load their data correctly
3. WHEN new modules are added THEN the system SHALL automatically include them in the loading process
4. IF a module has no JSON data THEN the system SHALL handle this gracefully without errors
5. WHEN global data is needed THEN the system SHALL load it from the global data folder

### Requirement 5: CSS Extraction and Organization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want module-specific CSS separated from the main stylesheet, so that I can maintain styles more efficiently and reduce conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CSS is extracted THEN the system SHALL move module-specific styles from styles.css to individual module CSS files
2. WHEN module CSS files are created THEN the system SHALL maintain the same styling functionality
3. WHEN the main stylesheet is updated THEN the system SHALL only contain global styles and imports
4. IF modules share common styles THEN the system SHALL keep shared styles in global CSS files
5. WHEN CSS files are organized THEN the system SHALL follow a consistent naming convention

### Requirement 6: JavaScript Module System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want each module's JavaScript functionality isolated, so that I can maintain and debug code more effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN modules require JavaScript THEN the system SHALL create dedicated JS files for each module
2. WHEN JavaScript files are created THEN the system SHALL avoid global variable conflicts
3. WHEN modules are loaded THEN the system SHALL automatically include required JavaScript files
4. IF modules don't need JavaScript THEN the system SHALL not create unnecessary JS files
5. WHEN JavaScript functionality is updated THEN the system SHALL only affect the specific module

### Requirement 7: Development Workflow

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clear workflow for creating and completing modules, so that I can efficiently develop new components and maintain existing ones.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting a new module THEN the system SHALL provide a clear template structure
2. WHEN a module is in development THEN the system SHALL keep it in the work-in-progress area
3. WHEN a module is completed THEN the system SHALL have a clear process for moving it to completed status
4. IF a module needs updates THEN the system SHALL allow easy modification of completed modules
5. WHEN modules are tested THEN the system SHALL provide easy ways to verify functionality
